                I was not a much of a ‚Äúphotographer‚Äù kinda guy back then.
                It‚Äôs all started in the break that I got after the O/L exam.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>
                I got a proper smart phone and first I played with it‚Äôs camera for bit.
                That‚Äôs when I fell in love with photography.
                I learned about basics and some more about photography
                through online courses and I started doing it more and more.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>
                So I got the title ‚Äúphotographer‚Äù from my buddies obviously ;)
            </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>
                I won a photographic contest held by HNB Finance in 2022.
            </li>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I love to use my words and voice to talk to hearts of people around me.
                So I wanted to learn presenting. As radio presenters can speak to heart
                without even showing any facial expression I wanted to learn that skill.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                So I joined school media unit and learned a lot about that subject and
                even have represented school for competitions.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>
                After that I wanted to improve my skills so I learned tv and radio
                presenting at Best Voice Media Academy under Mr. Harindra Jayalal.
                Sir thought well not only presenting but also public speaking and lot.

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In my first school every class had a library period and a
                IT period and both of them were in the same room.
                Thanks to who ever made that decision most of my
                friends including me fell in love with books and tech at the same time.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                And we had a massive library in my second school and I read a lot because of that.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>
                I joined the public library in the area and started buying new books too.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Even though we are in a digital world , reading a physical book gives
                a sensation that no other thing can give. So I love to read and I suggest
                you who ever reading this, Read some books (If you are not). I learned a
                hella lot from books, had amazing experiences reading them. I can‚Äôt push it more.
                If you are not reading you are missing a lot.

                Writing poems (nisandas,kavi) is one of best ways to relive stress for me.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When something bothers me a lot I just convert those feelings I‚Äôm having
                into words and they become beautiful crafts, according to who?
                you ask, according to me aneh..üòâ
            </li>
        </ul>


        <ul>
            <li>
                And sometimes I write poems to my friends, to people I admire ,
                to people I love and its a good way to appreciate someone.
                Not only that but also I write poems for my friends so they can
                give them to their significant other as something they wrote. üòä
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
